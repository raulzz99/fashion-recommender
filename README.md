# 📸 Simple Image Recommendation App (Streamlit)

This is a **demo Streamlit application** that allows users to upload an image and view "recommended similar images" from a gallery. Currently, the recommendation logic is a placeholder (it just shows all gallery images), but it can be extended with embeddings and a similarity search.

---

## Features
* Upload an image (JPG/PNG).
* Display the uploaded image.
* Show a set of gallery images as "recommendations."
* Works on both a **local machine** and a **remote server** (EC2, VM, etc.).

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3\. Install dependencies

```bash

### 4\. Add gallery images

Place your images inside the `gallery/` directory. The final project structure should look like this:

## ▶️ Running the App

### On a Local Machine

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

### On a Remote Server (e.g., AWS EC2)

To run the application on a remote server, specify the server address and port:

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

Access the application in your browser by replacing `<SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>` with your server's public IP address:

```
http://<SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>:8501
```

```
